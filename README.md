QUEST STATEMENT FOR BIG WIN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cells split 50 times before dying. Each time they split they duplicate with a potential mutation.
Visual?

Youth gene will go around inspecting cells and repairing heir mutations.

Age gene goes around attacking youth genes and killing them. Maybe turning gem into age genes?

At the start of ge simulation there are far more youth genes than age genes 1:10?

Over time the system should mutate but also at an increasing rate. As age genes remove youth genes.

Cool!
