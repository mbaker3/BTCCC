# README for a newly created project.

There are a couple of things you should do first, before you can use all of Git's power:

  * Add a remote to this project: in the Cloud9 IDE command line, you can execute the following commands
    `git remote add [remote name] [remote url (eg. 'git@github.com:/ajaxorg/node_chat')]` [Enter]
  * Create new files inside your project
  * Add them to to Git by executing the following command
    `git add [file1, file2, file3, ...]` [Enter]
  * Create a commit which can be pushed to the remote you just added
    `git commit -m 'added new files'` [Enter]
  * Push the commit the remote
    `git push [remote name] master` [Enter]

That's it! If this doesn't work for you, please visit the excellent resources from [Github.com](http://help.github.com) and the [Pro Git](http://http://progit.org/book/) book.
If you can't find your answers there, feel free to ask us via Twitter (@cloud9ide), [mailing list](groups.google.com/group/cloud9-ide) or IRC (#cloud9ide on freenode).

Happy coding!

QUEST STATEMENT FOR BIG WIN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cells split 50 times before dying. Each time they split they duplicate with a potential mutation.
Visual?

Youth gene will go around inspecting cells and repairing heir mutations.

Age gene goes around attacking youth genes and killing them. Maybe turning gem into age genes?

At the start of ge simulation there are far more youth genes than age genes 1:10?

Over time the system should mutate but also at an increasing rate. As age genes remove youth genes.

Cool!
